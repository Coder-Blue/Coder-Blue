## My history with some of the languages:
- Python - Started 2021 - Not very good at it at that time - Currently I just use it for data analytics, API tests.
- C++ - Started 2022 - I'm using cpp in some of the coding competitions.
- C# - Started 2022 - Not very recommnend using it, but it was a good language.
- Java - Started 2023 - Using it for my Minecraft server coding, not so my favor.
- 
- JavaScript - Started 2023 - Daily use and production currently.
- Rust - Started 2024 - Decent language, fast and safe, recommended.

**This is just my coding journey, I'm still trying to adapt to some new stuffs these days**

## Current workflow tools:
- **JavaScript - React and Svelte**
- **Cloud Database - Google Firebase**
- **Database - MongoDB and Cassandra**
- **Rust - Tauri**
- **Python - OpenCV and Pandas**

And this is some of the technologies, I'd like to use, and of course, for the preferences:

It's just my personal favor guys, you guys should learn something new everday, my poor taste shouldn't affect you guys.
